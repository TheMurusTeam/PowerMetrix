# PowerMetrix
Display power consumption on Apple Silicon Macs<br><br>
PowerMetrix is a small app that displays Apple Silicon SOC power consumption.<br>
It runs as a menulet in macOS menu bar. The icon displays current package consumption. Click the icon to display main window where consumption history is displayed and updated in real-time every second.<br><br>
When running PowerMetrix for the first time you will be asked to install its privileged helper tool. This is needed because Powermetrix is basically a GUI frontend for the macOS built-in /usr/bin/powermetrics tool, which requires root privileges to run.<br><Br>Once helper is installed PowerMetrix will quit. Restart PowerMetrix.<br><br>
System Requirements:<br>
This release of PowerMetrix requires an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 12 Monterey.
Intel Macs are not and will not be supported.<br><br>
